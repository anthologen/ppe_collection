# 3D Printable Healthcare Visor Remix
This is a remix of [Shawn Lim's 3D Printable Healthcare Visors](https://botcamp.org/2020/03/22/3d-printable-healthcare-visors). This remix isolates the visor's side hooks and attaches clips to them. All components are meant to clip into a cheap dollar store hairband. Since it's a small model, it can be printed by the smallest category of 3D printers.

**Disclaimer**: I make no claims of medical benefit. Use at your own risk. [The original design has been vetted](https://theppedrive.com/3d-printed-visor). This remix has not. Do not ship this to the crowdsourced PPE supply chain without first reaching out to them.
